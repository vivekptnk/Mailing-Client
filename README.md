# Mailing-Client
This is a mailing client in python using SMTP. 

`main.py` uses Gmail SMTP, feel free to use it with other SMTP clients. 
Create two new files and name them `password.txt` and 'email.txt' and add your password and email inside it, I recommend encrypting the `.txt` files and decrypting them in the main.py file, this program doesn't do that.
